              <p>
                You plan in a <strong>chat</strong> with a guide. The plan lives in the <strong>Trip Studio</strong>: one
                page with the day plan, a hand-drawn sketchbook, a map, a 3D route, the weather, the budget and the
                exports. Anything you change in the chat is saved to the studio straight away, and a small receipt
                under the reply tells you exactly what changed.
              </p>
              <Steps>
                <li><strong>Say where you're going.</strong> Your guide asks three quick things: where from, where to,
                  and how many days. Everything else is optional.</li>
                <li><strong>Pick how to plan.</strong> Get the whole itinerary written at once, or build it one day at
                  a time with your guide.</li>
                <li><strong>Open the studio</strong> to see the plan as days, a sketchbook, a map and a 3D route.</li>
                <li><strong>Change anything by asking.</strong> <q>Move the market to day 1.</q> It happens, and the
                  studio follows.</li>

                saved at once. There is no draft to confirm and no <q>finalize</q> button. Under every reply that
                changed something, a <strong>receipt</strong> lists what actually changed, with <strong>Open studio
                </strong> beside it.
              </p>
              <Shot src="05b-change-receipt" alt="A revised itinerary ending in a receipt that lists the added place">
                We asked <q>Can you add the Arashiyama bamboo grove on the morning of day 2?</q> The reply is the
                whole plan, revised (this is the end of it). The receipt under it is the record: the grove was added
                to day 2. The draft already had it on day 3, and the revision kept that as an optional second look.
              </Shot>
              <p>
                If you ask for <strong>advice</strong> instead (<q>is there anything you'd move?</q>), your guide answers
                and offers one specific change. A plain <q>yes</q> applies it.
              </p>
              <Shot src="05c-offer" alt="A question answered with one specific offer">
                We asked <q>Day 1 looks busy. Is there anything you'd move to another day?</q> The plan isn't touched,
                so there is no receipt: the reply suggests one move (Nishiki Market to day 2) and asks whether to
                make it.
              </Shot>
              <Shot src="05d-yes-applied" alt="The plan after replying yes, with a receipt for the move">
                We replied <q>yes</q>. The market moved, and the receipt names the place and the days. The same
                revision dropped the second bamboo-grove visit from day 3, and the receipt lists that too: every
                line is something that changed in the saved plan, whether or not the reply mentions it.

                three things, and tells you about them instead of getting in your way.

                <li><strong>Budget.</strong> Same again: the change is made, and the heads-up says how far over budget

                <li><strong>Your own rules.</strong> Things you said to avoid, and places you turned down, are the one

              <h2>Questions &amp; fixes</h2>
              <dl className="tv-howto__faq">
                <dt>How do I finalize or save the plan?</dt>
                <dd>You don't have to. Every change is saved to the studio the moment it's made, and the receipt under
                  the reply confirms it. <q>Finish</q> only writes a wrap-up.</dd>
                <dt>The reply said it changed something, but I see no receipt.</dt>
                <dd>Then nothing changed. The receipt comes from the saved plan; trust it over the wording of a reply.
                  Ask again more plainly, for example <q>move Nishiki Market to day 1</q>.</dd>
                <dt>I asked for a change and got a question back.</dt>
                <dd>Your message read as a request for advice, so your guide offered a change instead of making it.
                  Reply <q>yes</q>, or phrase it as a request: <q>move …</q>, <q>add …</q>, <q>can you …</q>.</dd>
                <dt>My export didn't download.</dt>
                <dd>Open <strong>Export</strong> again: a file that took a while waits behind a <strong>Save</strong> button.
                  If your browser asks whether this site may download several files, allow it.</dd>
                <dt>Why is Calendar greyed out in Export?</dt>
                <dd>A calendar needs dates. Pick a day in the <strong>Trip starts on</strong> field under it and it
                  becomes available.</dd>
                <dt>Are the prices real quotes?</dt>
                <dd>No. They're typical amounts from traveler reports and estimates, always marked with ~ or
                  <q>Suggested</q>. Nothing is booked. Enter what you actually pay in the Budget planner.</dd>
                <dt>Is the weather a forecast?</dt>
                <dd>Only when your trip is near, and then it says <q>Forecast</q>. Further out it's typical weather for
                  that month, labelled <q>Typical for …</q>.</dd>
                <dt>The total is over budget before I've added anything.</dt>
                <dd>When you build with your guide, the total includes hotel nights and daily food for the whole trip.
                  Raise the budget, or tell your guide your real hotel and food costs.</dd>
                <dt>Does switching days lose my plan?</dt>
                <dd>No. Every day keeps its plan. Switching is instant and doesn't message your guide.</dd>
                <dt>Nothing was suggested for a day.</dt>
                <dd>Say what you're in the mood for (<q>street food and a quiet garden</q>). Your guide notes it and
                  searches traveler posts for that day.</dd>
                <dt>Can I change my guide or the brief?</dt>
                <dd>Yes, with <strong>Edit details</strong> on the planning card, before you pick how to plan.</dd>
                <dt>Where do the photos come from?</dt>

                  each reply and <strong>Open studio</strong> beside it; <q>yes</q> applies an offer; the budget can be
                  set from the chat. The build-with-your-guide panel became a one-line <strong>day dock</strong>, so
                  the conversation keeps the screen. The trip brief comes in <strong>four small steps</strong> with
                  Skip the rest, and the planner opens with a greeting. <strong>Exports</strong> that take a while wait
                  behind a Save button, and the calendar works for trips without dates. This guide was rebuilt.</li>
